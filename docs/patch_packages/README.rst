Creating Patch Packages
=======================

Patch packages contain ROM patches, the XML definitions
and the Python logic for applying them.

The SkyTemple core patches are instead directly contained in the core ppmdu XML
configuration and the ``skytemple_files.patch`` package.

However as an example for this mechanism, the ``ActorLoader`` patch is also contained
in the ``actor_loader.skypatch`` archive.
